                  Joint Entrance Examination (JEE Main) comprises of two papers. The Paper1 is conducted for admission to Undergraduate Engineering Programs (B.E/B. Tech) at NITs, IIITs, other Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs), Institutions/Universities funded/recognized by participating State Governments, as well as an eligibility test for JEE (Advanced), which is conducted for admission to IITs. Candidates of UPSEE (2021) will take JEE (Main) 2021. The Paper 2 is conducted for admission to B. Arch and B. Planning courses in the Country. From this year, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), Lucknow will also use the score sheet of JEE (Main) â€“ 2021 for admission to the B.Tech / M.Tech (Integrated)/B.Arch. Courses in its affiliated colleges across the State.
The JEE (Main) 2021 will be conducted in multiple sessions for admissions in the next academic session. The candidates will thus benefit in the following ways:
â–ª This will give multiple opportunities to the candidates to improve their scores in the
examination if they are not able to give their best in one attempt.
â–ª In first attempt, the students will get a first-hand experience of taking an examination and will know their mistakes which they can improve while attempting for the next time.
â–ª This will reduce the chances of dropping a year and droppers would not have to
waste a full year.
â–ª If anyone missed the examination due to reasons beyond control (such as Board
examination), then he/she will not have to wait for one full year.
â–ª A candidate need not appear in all the four Sessions. However, if candidate appears in more than one Session then his/her best of the 2021 NTA Scores will be considered for preparation of Merit List/ Ranking.
